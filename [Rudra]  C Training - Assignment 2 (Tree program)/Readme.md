# C Tree Program

This C program demonstrates the implementation of a basic binary search tree (BST). It includes functionalities to create a tree, insert nodes, calculate the height of the tree, and free the allocated memory.

## File Structure

- `main.c`: Contains the main function and user interaction.
- `tree.c`: Implements tree-related functions (insertNode, createNode, freeTree, treeHeight).
- `tree.h`: Header file with the Node structure and function declarations.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to compile and run the program:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <YOUR-GITHUB-URL>
   cd C-Tree-Program
2. **Compile the Program:**
   ```bash
   gcc main.c tree.c -o myProgram

3.**Run the Program:**
```bash
./myProgram
```
## Usage

1. **Enter Node Information:**
   - When prompted, enter the ID and project name for each node.

2. **Insert Nodes into the Tree:**
   - The program will insert the entered nodes into the binary search tree.

3. **Calculate and Display Tree Height:**
   - After inserting nodes, the program will calculate and display the height of the tree.

4. **Free Allocated Memory:**
   - Finally, the program will free the allocated memory before exiting.
